# USED TECHNOLOGY
HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT

I have used HTML5 and CSS3 to make layouts, design and to make website responsive.
Javascript DOM to add funtionality of hamburger menu in mobiles and tablets since i have used pure css.

I have divided whole website into small small section by using section tag.
after that first started with the navbar and added hamburger menu for mobiles and tablets.
after that created the banner section by using multilayer background concept to add a transparent dark layer on
the image background so the text can be more clearly visible.
Mostly i have used flex property because it is supported by most of the browser as compare to grid box.

some section has small hyphen to seperate the two contents. to make this hyphen i have used pseudo element ::after
I have tried my best to make the same layout by using similar fonts.
